# Portfolio

## Projects
### CLI Access of CHATGPT
- Built a Python command-line tool that connects to the OpenAI API for real-time AI interaction using secure environment variables. Learned how to package a CLI app, manage dependencies, and create a custom alias for easy terminal access.

### Envelopes Budgeting App (OOP)
- A command‑line application that allows users to create and manage objects, with data stored persistently in a .txt file. Developed to practice working with object‑oriented programming and file I/O for data persistence.

### Employee Portal 1.0 (Procedural) 
- Developed a command‑line application that assigns and rotates duties among employees. At this point in my learning, I had limited knowledge of persistent storage, so I implemented a creative data structure and a continuous prompt loop to manage state — preserving duty assignments across rotations until the program was intentionally stopped.

### Workshop Projects (NUCAMP Backend Bootcamp)
- Throughout the week we would emerse ourselves in the material, gaining new knowledge and each weekend we had an oppurtunity to come together as a team learning to communicate and collaborate while applying what we had learned. These are the projects I coded from instruction.
